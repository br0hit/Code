Object oriented programming : 

Object oriented programming may sound similar to that of the structures but the main difference is that in the case of structures in C/C++ we cannot define functions inside a structure so we use the new notation of objects

objects allow us to store all the different kinds of data together and also define functions inside them 

Main principles of object oriented programming :

Encapsulaiton
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism



THE CHERNO : 

Pre processing files : 

The # is a pre processing file , when a compiler first receives a code , it looks for the # 
Then include will search for the files which you want in your current program and add them

These are called header files

iostream contains cout and cin

there is int main() but we dont return any integer this is because the main function is a special case

Now when we write cout<< the '<<' is also bascially a operator
